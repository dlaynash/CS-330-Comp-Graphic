1.) How do I approach designing software?
2.) What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
3.) What design process did you follow for your project work?
4.) How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My approach to designing software is to first understand what the end product or subject will be. It is important to plan before starting the actual coding process because it acts as a blueprint and provides direction when needed. The design skills that I crafted while working on this project were to consider the placement and textures of the 3D scene that I was recreating. I didn't want my design to look unorganized so I altered the placements I thought looked best. The design process that I followed was choosing the best strategy to recreate my shapes in fewer steps and choosing textures that captured the idea of my 3D scene since the textures wouldn't be exact. The tactics used in this project could be applied to future work when considering the design and execution aspects. These are two important things to consider depending on what is being designed. 

5.) How do I approach developing programs?
6.) What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
7.) How did iteration factor into your development?
8.) How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
When it comes to the developing process, I approach it in a manner where it does not overcomplicate my code. It is important to consider the organization of your code and include comments to maintain that structure. Having my mesh code on separate files helped when troubleshooting errors and identifying them faster. The new strategy that I used was separating my files as I have previously worked out of one main source code file which was not as structured as this project. I didn't realize the importance and convenience of separating my files. I believe that my approach to developing code evolved a lot during this course as it was the most challenging but interesting because it combined programming and something that I was extremely interested in. There was a lot of trial and error but as the weeks progressed the errors became clearer and I was able to overcome a lot of the hurdles that appeared in previous weeks. Luckily I ended up with a much more polished version of my 3D scene each time. 

9.) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
10.) How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
11.) How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computer science can help me reach my goals because it can be applied to many fields and in many cases can provide me with more opportunities. Having technical abilities makes your professional skills much more marketable. Computer graphics and visualizations have provided me with a lot of new knowledge that could be applied both to my educational and professional pathway. This course has helped me improve my existing development skills and has helped me gain new programming skills which are important in Computer Science. As for my future professional pathway, it has given me a preview of the fields and industries I have an interest, and I can build on the skills I have learned throughout this course.
